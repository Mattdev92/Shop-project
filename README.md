# Shop project

Hi ! I've just made my first e-commerce project using React & Redux to practisethose technologies.

Implemented solutions

 1. Cards displayed in grid view
 2. Details view of products
 3. Shopping card funcionality: add to shopping cart, delete from cart 
 4. Possibility of changing quantity of products in cart
 5. Contact and order form
